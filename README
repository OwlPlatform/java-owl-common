== About ==
  This library contains common classes and routines used by other components
  of the Owl Platform.

== Compiling ==
  This library should be compiled using the Apache Maven project management tool.
  The project is currently compatible with Apache Maven version 3, which
  can be downloaded for free at <http://maven.apache.org/>.  To build the
  JAR file, the following command should be run from the project root (where
  the pom.xml file is located):

    mvn clean package -U

  If everything compiles correctly, then near the end of the Maven output,
  this line should appear:

    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

  In this case, the JAR file will be located in the ``target'' subdirectory.
  If not, please visit the project website listed at the top of this
  document for support.
